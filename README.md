"Email Thread Sentiment Analysis" project, utilizing the Enron Email Dataset, which comprises over 500,000 emails from the Enron Company. 
The preprocessing phase involved removing unwanted symbols such as @ and #, ensuring data consistency, and handling null values. 
Three machine learning models-Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and K-nearest Neighbors (KNN)-were employed in conjunction with three sentiment analyzer models:
VADERSent. TextBlob, and SentiWordNet (SWN). Additionally, sentiment classification visualization was facilitated using the NRCLexicon Module.
The project includes graphs illustrating confusion matrices and performance metrics for the three machine learning models across the three sentiment analyzer models.
Notably, the Random Forest Classifier achieved the highest accuracy of 100% on VADERSent, followed by Logistic Regression and KNN. 
Comparable accuracies were observed for other machine learning models on alternative sentiment analyzer
models. Through thorough analysis and viqualization, this project ofters valuable
insights into email sentiment classification, Thowcasing the effectiveness of various machine learning techniques and sentiment analyzer models.
